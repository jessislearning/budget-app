# üí≥ Budget App 
The Budget App contains two main parts:
<h3> ‚≠êÔ∏è A python class called "Category" ‚≠êÔ∏è</h3><br>
which takes user input for a budget category for the following actions: <br>
- deposit<br>
- withdraw<br>
- get balance<br>
- transfer<br>
- check funds<br>
<br>
As an example:<br>

<br>
<h3>‚≠êÔ∏è A function called "create_spend_chart" ‚≠êÔ∏è</h3><br>
which creates a string-formatted visualization. The chart shows for the amounts (withdrawals) per category as a percentage of total spending.
